## Two Frontends - gamescreen and controller

- The gamescreen frontend is where most of the game logic lies (growing and eating food, moving through the walls, dying and points counting) as well as rendering the snake movement, food display and all the other visual aspects.
- the controller has vibration feedback on touch (only on chrome)

## Backend as a service?

- The interesting part about this app is that it has no BE in the traditional sense, but leverages AWS AppSync, a fully managed GraphQL server to handle all the connections. Under the hood, it uses WebSocket technology, which gives the app a real-time feel. 
- Movement instructions were mutations sent from the controller through a subscription.
